    "# MLOps Hackathon\n",
    "\n",
    "This hackathon is based on the [open-source Turbo Template](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/vertex-pipelines-end-to-end-samples).\n",
    "Through this notebook series you'll get hands-on with the template and Google Cloud.\n",
    "The hackathon is structured into the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Health check](./01_health_check.ipynb)\n",
    "1. [Run pipelines](./02_run_pipelines.ipynb)\n",
    "1. [Promote model](./03_promote_model.ipynb)\n",
    "1. **[Challenge: Model monitoring](./04_monitoring_challenge.ipynb) - this notebook**\n",
    "1. [Challenge: Real-time predictions](./05_realtime_challenge.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you (or your team) is asked to monitor your pipelines in depth.\n",
    "This involves granular logging, the creation of alerts, and proper notification channels, so that you can mitigate in case your alert is fired."

    "**‚û°Ô∏è Exercise:** Open a previous pipeline run:\n",
    "1. Investigate the logs of each step. \n",
    "1. Can you filter logs? If so, find a specific log (e.g. in your model training step).\n",
    "1. Aim to get a good understanding of how logs are structured and read through the documentation of the respective Google Cloud service."
